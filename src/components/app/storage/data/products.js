      'A project of the Chrysler Corporation, developed in the summer of 1946. The vehicle featured a number of design solutions that were not typical of U.S. tank-building. In particular, the Chrysler K was to have its transmission and engine located in the front, and the armament compartment in the rear of the hull. All crew members would have sat in the turret. It is thought that this project was the first U.S. project to position the driver in the turret. It was not supported by the army due to limited funding.\nThis Premium vehicle has a 10% bonus XP earn and a 50% bonus Silver earn.',
